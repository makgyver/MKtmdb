MKtmdb
======

The Movie Database (TMDb) API wrapper written in Java.
This library provides classes and methods to fully access the TMDb API 
(you can look at the API through this link http://api.themoviedb.org/)
with Java, so you can use it in desktop application as well as in android
application or whatever.
This project is thinked in a layered fashion so you can use it at the level you prefer:
you can only need the URL to call the API or you can need a fully structured architecture that goes through the 
information retrieved from the API. This and much more can do easly with this library.
As explained in the link above, to use the TMDb API you must first require an API Key.
